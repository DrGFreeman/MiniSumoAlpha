# MiniSumoAlpha
A Mini-Sumo robot project based on the Pololu A-Star32U4 robot controller.

## Summary
This library for the Arduino IDE is intended to provide different classes with high level methods to control a mini-sumo robot. The different classes handle the low level functions transparently to the user. This will allow the main sketch to remain simple and focus on the robot strategy.

This library is a work in progress. See the following links for more details:
